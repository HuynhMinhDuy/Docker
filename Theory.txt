- Docker engine consist of 3 components : Docker CLI, Docker REST API, Docker deamon
    1. Docker CLI can local on different host and use command to access another docker engine
       For example : :$ docker -H=remote-docker-engine:2375
                     :$ docker -H=10.1.2.3:2375 run nginx   
- Folder docker :
    /var/lib/docker

- Docker is client-server architecture
- Docker deamon can not run on non-linux platforms natively because it uses linux specific kernel feature. 
- The -i flag starts an interact container
- The -t flag creates a pseudo-TTY that attaches stdin and stdout
