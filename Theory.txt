- Docker engine consist of 3 components : Docker CLI, Docker REST API, Docker deamon
    1. Docker CLI can local on different host and use command to access another docker engine
       For example : :$ docker -H=remote-docker-engine:2375
                     :$ docker -H=10.1.2.3:2375 run nginx   
- Folder docker :
    /var/lib/docker

- Docker is client-server architecture
- Docker deamon can not run on non-linux platforms natively because it uses linux specific kernel feature. 
- The -i flag starts an interact container
- The -t flag creates a pseudo-TTY that attaches stdin and stdout

- 4 type of network in docker :
    * Closed Network / None Network --> Isolated network, can not ping outside the internet
    * Bridge Network --> By default, bridge network can not ping each other. However, we  can use connect to create a new interface network for docker container
    * Host Network
    * Overlay Network

Bridge Network :

    In a bridge network, containers have access to two network interfaces:
        - A loopback interface
        - A private interface
    All containers in the same bridge network can communicate with each other
    Containers from different bridge networks can not connect with each other by default
    Reduce the level of network isolation in favor of better outside connectivity

Host Network:
    Minimum network security level
    Leave the container widely unprotected
    But, it has high level performent than bridge network because iptable port mapping
    
    NOTE : Dont use it in production, only have valid reasons
